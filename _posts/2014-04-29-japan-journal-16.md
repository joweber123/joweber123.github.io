My poems are always unfinished: for,
written at the peak of a fancy,
all the love diesâ€”
and I have no energy to chronicle
the endings,
Sad little half-polished stones, they lie in my closet;
just as well incomplete,
for the imagined beauty beneath
the roughness
is better than the truth of
the faults
-Hunter Heath III
